  Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a fictional movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use i ts existing movie l icenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.
   
   I’ve been hired as a data analyst by Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence
department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI
department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related
queries. Your first task is to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database
management system (RDBMS). Then, I’ll use SQL to analyze the data and answer any
ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.

Key Questions and Objectives

  The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and
they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their company strategy. Here are
the main questions they’d like to answer:

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Where are customers with a high l ifetime value based?

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

Data Set
 
 I’ll be using a data set that contains information about Rockbuster’s
film inventory, customers, and payments, among other things.
