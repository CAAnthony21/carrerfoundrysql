-- Find titles that are less than 1.99

SELECT *
FROM film  
WHERE rental_rate < 1.99

-- Set release year for 'The Matrix' to 1999

UPDATE film
SET release_year = 1999
WHERE title = 'The Matrix'

-- Delete title 'The Avengers: End Game' from table

DELETE
FROM film
WHERE title ='The Avengers:End Game'

-- select and display all columns from the film table for only 10 records
SELECT *
FROM film
LIMIT 10;

-- rename title and description columns as 'movie_name' and 'movie_summary'

SELECT title AS movie_name,
       description AS movie_summary
FROM film

-- change 'film' table to 'movie'

SELECT *
FROM film AS movie

-- Write a SELECT command to find out what film genres exist in the category table.

SELECT *
FROM category

-- Write an INSERT statement to add the following genres to the category table: Thriller, Crime, Mystery, Romance, and War:

INSERT INTO category (name)

INSERT INTO category (name)

FROM film
WHERE title = 'African Egg'

UPDATE film_category
SET category_id = 17
WHERE film_id = 5

DELETE FROM category
